HLStatsX:CE Import Ban Options
----------------------
Description:
HLStatsX:CE has two different scripts to use to import bans from your banning system:

1) ImportBans
ImportBans.pl is a perl script and is the original importing script.
It only imports bans and does not unban a player if they're unbanned from your ban system.
This script supports SourceBans, AMXBans, BeetleMod, and GlobalBan.
You must have perl installed to use this script.

2) hlstatsxbans
Hlstatsxbans is written by Peace-Maker and is written in PHP.
This script will ban AND UNBAN players as they are banned from your banning system.

This script suports SourceBans, AMXBans, BeetleMod, and GlobalBan.
You must have PHP installed to use this script.

Configuration:
Select which ban system you want to use, either ImportBans or HLStatsXBans.  You must then edit the corresponding file.

*run_importbans
** Open run_importbans in a text editor
** Configure "BANSYSTEM" for which script you would like to use. 

*ImportBans
** Open ImportBans.pl in a text editor.
** Fill in the HLX DB INFO section (should be same as that found in hlstats.conf in the Perl directory)
** Fill in at least one of the other databases (Sourcebans, AMXBans, BeetlesMod) that you want to import from.

NOTE: You can use any of these databases simultaneously -- fill in the ones you want
to pull from and those databases will be queried.

*HLStatsXBans
** Open HLStatsXBans.cfg in a text editor.
** Fill in the database info for HLX.
** Fill in at least one of the other databases that you want to import from.

Running:
You should run the script manually one time to make sure everything is working.
To run ImportBans, run:

./importbans.pl

To run HLStatsXBans, run:

php hlstatsxbans.php

If everything works, you can either schedule the exact same command you just executed to run at a configured interval or time,
or use the run_importbans wrapper to get logging (great for console use).
To use run_importbans, make sure you have edited the file for which script you want to use, and then simply execute:

./run_importbans.

Note: you will not get any output from this script.  Everything is written into your logs/ directory.
