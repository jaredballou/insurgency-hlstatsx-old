hlstats-ftp.pl README

Utility written by Woody.

This utility can be used to grab log files from a remote game server through FTP and then use the HLStatsX Daemon to enter
the data into the database.  You must have perl installed to use this utility.

The script "remembers" the modification time (mtime) of the last log file that has been processed, and when run again,
only processes files with a later mtime.

*** NOTE ***
To use this utility you must copy it into the same folder your hlstats.pl (the daemon) is in.
You probably want to configure this as a cronjob as well.
