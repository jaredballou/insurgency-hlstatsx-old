You can give each weapon a <i>points modifier</i>, a multiplier which determines how many points will be gained or lost for killing with or being killed by that weapon. (Refer to <a href="<?php echo $g_options["scripturl"]; ?>?mode=help#points">Help</a> for a full description of how points ratings are 
calculated.) The baseline points modifier for weapons is 1.00. A points modifier of 0.00 will cause kills with that weapon to have no effect on players' points.<p>
