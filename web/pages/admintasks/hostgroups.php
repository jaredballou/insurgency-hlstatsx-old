Host Groups allow you to group, for example, all players from "...adsl.someisp.net" as "SomeISP ADSL", in the Host Statistics admin tool.<p>

The Host Pattern should look like the <b>end</b> of the hostname. For example a pattern ".adsl.someisp.net" will match "1234.ny.adsl.someisp.net". You can use asterisks "*" in the pattern, e.g. ".ny.*.someisp.net". The asterisk matches zero or more of any character except a dot ".".<p>

The patterns are sorted below in the order they will be applied. A more specific pattern should match before a less specific pattern.<p>

<b>Note</b> Run <b>hlstats-resolve.pl --regroup</b> to apply grouping changes to existing data.<p>
