Here you can define the patterns used to determine what clan a player is in. These patterns are applied to players' names when they connect or change name.<p>

Special characters in the pattern:<p>

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4>

<tr class="head">
	<td class="fSmall">Character</td>
	<td class="fSmall">Description</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td class="fNormal"><tt>A</tt></td>
	<td class="fNormal">Matches one character  (i.e. a character is required)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td class="fNormal"><tt>X</tt></td>
	<td class="fNormal">Matches zero or one characters  (i.e. a character is optional)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td class="fNormal"><tt>a</tt></td>
	<td class="fNormal">Matches literal A or a</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td class="fNormal"><tt>x</tt></td>
	<td class="fNormal">Matches literal X or x</td>
</tr>

</table><p>

Example patterns:<p>

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4>

<tr class="head">
	<td class="fSmall">Pattern</td>
	<td class="fSmall">Description</td>
	<td class="fSmall">Example</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td class="fNormal"><tt>[AXXXXX]</tt></td>
	<td class="fNormal">Matches 1 to 6 characters inside square braces</td>
	<td class="fNormal"><tt>[ZOOM]Player</tt></td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td class="fNormal"><tt>{AAXX}</tt></td>
	<td class="fNormal">Matches 2 to 4 characters inside curly braces</td>
	<td class="fNormal"><tt>{S3G}Player</tt></td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td class="fNormal"><tt>rex>></tt></td>
	<td class="fNormal">Matches the string "rex>>", "REX>>", etc.</td>
	<td class="fNormal"><tt>REX>>Tyranno</tt></td>
</tr>

</table><p>

Avoid adding patterns to the database that are too generic. Always ensure you have at least one literal (non-special) character in the pattern -- for example if you were to add the pattern "AXXA", it would match any player with 2 or more letters in their name!<p>

The Match Position field sets which end of the player's name the clan tag is allowed to appear.<p>

	$result = $db->query("
		SELECT
			id,
			pattern,
			position
		FROM
			hlstats_ClanTags
		ORDER BY
			id
	");
	
	$edlist->draw($result);
