You can make an action map-specific by prepending the map name and an underscore to the Action Code. For example, if the map "<b>rock2</b>" has an action "<b>goalitem</b>" then you can either make the action code just "<b>goalitem</b>" (in which case it will match all maps) or you can make it "<b>rock2_goalitem</b>" to match only on the "rock2" map.<p>
