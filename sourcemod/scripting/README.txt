As of HLX:CE 1.6.0, the hlstatsx.sp does not add any extra log information. To get auxilary logging for more actions supported by HLX:CE, please run the SuperLogs plugin for your game (in extras/SuperLogs or on the AlliedModders site). If a SuperLogs plugin is not available for your game, it is likely that the "SuperLogs: Generic" plugin will still be of use to add some extra information.
